This project is a comprehensive data analysis exercise using Power BI, aimed at building a real-world interactive dashboard based on employee data. The focus is on exploring different themes and scenarios to extract valuable insights about the workforce. The project involves using a sample dataset to create new measures, apply advanced visualizations, and incorporate interactive elements like slicers and filters. Here’s a breakdown of each theme and what it entails:

How many people are there in each department?

Create a new measure called “Head Count” to visualize the number of employees per department. This provides a clear view of the distribution of the workforce across different departments.
Gender distribution by department

Use visual graphs like bar charts or stacked columns to show the gender distribution within each department, enhancing clarity and visual appeal.
Age spread of our staff (histogram)

Create a histogram using bins to group age ranges and apply conditional formatting, gradients, or rules to highlight different segments of the age spread for easy interpretation.
Min / max / average salary in each department

Develop measures to calculate the minimum, maximum, and average salary per department. Use visuals like a gauge chart and incorporate slicers for filtering departments or other attributes dynamically.
Top earners in each country

Filter the dataset to show the top 5 earners in each country, providing insights into the highest-paid employees by location.
Performance Spread (sort by column)

Sort employee performance data using specific columns to visualize and analyze performance distribution effectively.
